# Aiken_project_CoinToCare
This is the 'final project' code for the Emurgo Aiken Developer course, Roberto Cerrud. 

**Introduction**
CareToCoin is a decentralized donation platform (DApp) that uses Cardano’s ADA cryptocurrency and smart contracts to provide a seamless, compliant, and automated way for donors to contribute to charities or causes with ADA, Cardano’s native crypto token. The DApp converts donations into fiat currency and deposits them directly into the recipient’s bank account while simultaneously generating tax forms for both the donor and the recipient. With built-in jurisdictional compliance, CareToCoin ensures that donations meet all legal requirements. If a donation is deemed ineligible, the donor is prompted to reclaim the funds, less fees, or the smart contract redirects the funds to an IRS-controlled wallet after 24 hours.
