# Aiken_project_CoinToCare
This is the 'final project' code for the Emurgo Aiken Developer course, Roberto Cerrud. 

**Introduction**
CareToCoin is a decentralized donation platform (DApp) that uses Cardano’s ADA cryptocurrency and smart contracts to provide a seamless, compliant, and automated way for donors to contribute to charities or causes with ADA, Cardano’s native crypto token. The DApp immediately converts donations into fiat currency and deposits them directly into the recipient’s bank account while simultaneously generating tax forms for both the donor and the recipient. With built-in jurisdictional compliance, CareToCoin ensures that donations meet all legal requirements. If a donation is deemed ineligible, the donor is prompted to reclaim the funds. If the non-jurisdictionally compliant funds are not reclaimed within 24 hours or the wallet is found to be on a known list of banned wallets, the amount of the donation, less fees, is  redirected to an IRS-controlled wallet.
